### 六级标准范文

> ​		***the importance of the social responsibility***
>
> ​	Our society has changed dramatically since the industry revolution, which also rebuilt our culture. It is true that our society advocates the maximum of the profits, while it is never the excuse of the ignorance of devotion spirit and the sense of social responsibility. 
> ​	As a matter of fact, a sense of responsibility can be of great significance. First of all, it distinguished we human beings from the wild animals that we fight for some noble beliefs. Therefore, there is no circumstances that we can forget such a good quality. In addition, even we view this issue from the angle of pure interest, only if the “cake” gets enlarged constantly can every individual enjoy more welfare. That is to say, having a sense of social responsibility and making more efforts can bring our community sustainable development in the long run. What’s more, a society full of the so called refined egoist will finally perish. Because when people no longer care about the surroundings, there is no way that humans get united and the basis of the civilization will be crushed.
> ​	Since it’s so important to have a sense of social responsibility, there are some advice. On the one hand, it’s always a good choice to turn to education system so that the sense of social responsibility can be cultivated. On the other hand, the community should offer wider channel of public issues to let more civilians join in and thus experience the value of social responsibility. With the measures taken, hopefully, I believe we human beings can finally get firmly united and become one voice, one fist and one army.

### 基本解题思路

1. 利用错位听音法，先预览后听音，变被动听音为主动寻找
2. 预览选项，分析选项之间的逻辑关系，推测原文大意及问题
3. 听音时，把握keywords，即正确答案出现的标志词

| 说明60s               | 第一题选项 |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| 放音1                 | 边听边涂   |
| 放音问题(13s-15s * 4) | 第二题选项 |
| 放音2                 | 边听边涂   |
| 放音问题              | 看第三组   |

- 预览速度：每道题四个选项预览13-15s
- 先纵向再横向。先了解大致方向，在做选项具体分析
- 如果阅读速度慢，不必全看，可以只看2-3个选项
- 分析不同题干下相关联的选项
- 用笔将预判的结果标注再纸上

indispensable = essential 不可或缺的

> ​	While technological is causing a revolution in education and has offered great benefits, it can cause problems sometimes. As vividly depicted in the picture, the kid tells his teacher he needs tech support to work out a simple mathematical problem(间接转述). The eye-catching scene reveals that students nowadays become increasingly dependent on technological devices and gradually become passive learners.

**主体段**

正反论证 whether technology is indispensable in education?

正方观点：agree 科技在教育中是不可或缺的

​					原因：科技对教育的好处：提高效率，提高了学习机会

​					例子：老师在课堂中融入照片和视频，让学生更投入到课堂中。

反方观点：disagree 科技在教育中并不是必须的 = 有的时候需要 有的时候不需要科技 = 合理的在教育中使用

​					原因：学生会容易分心并且过度依赖科技而丧失了一些基本技能

​					例子：

> On the one hand, some people hold the view that ...... To be specific, they claim that ..... For example, ...... . On the other hand, from the perspective of some educationists and scientists, ...... . This is due to the fact that ...... For instance, .....
>
> On the one hand, some people hold the view that technology has become an indispensable part of education. To be specific, they claim that educational technology allows students to reap benefits in terms of better learning experience and improved efficiency. For example, teachers can now incorporate images and videos when delivering lessons to keep students engaged in the class. On the other hand, from the perspective of some educationists and scientists, technology should be used properly/cautiously/appropriately. This is due to the fact that some students who lack of self-discipline will be easily distracted by technological tools and tend to be over-dependent on technology, gradually losing some basic abilities. For instance, many English learners rely on computers to type words and always forget the correct spelling of some words.
